 *  @param keyPath    The root keyPath of the model object.  Can be nil.

 *  @param failure    A block object to be executed when the task finishes unsuccessfully, or that finishes successfully, but encountered an error while parsing the response data. This block has no return value and takes a two arguments: the data task and the error describing the network or parsing error that occurred.
